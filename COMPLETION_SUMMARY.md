# 🎉 API Refactoring Complete!

## Summary

Your Spring Boot application has been successfully refactored to support an **instructor-only course management system** with the following features:

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Authentication APIs** (4 endpoints)
- ✅ Register new instructor account
- ✅ Login with JWT authentication
- ✅ Refresh access token
- ✅ Logout (invalidate refresh token)

### 2. **User Profile APIs** (2 endpoints)
- ✅ Get current user profile
- ✅ Edit/update current user profile

### 3. **Course Management APIs** (4 endpoints)
- ✅ Create course with file uploads (multipart/form-data)
- ✅ View single course with all course content
- ✅ View all courses by instructor
- ✅ Update course with additional file uploads

### 4. **Course Content APIs** (1 endpoint)
- ✅ Soft delete course content

**Total: 11 API Endpoints**

---

## 📝 Key Changes Made

### Entities
- **CourseContent**: Added `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` fields for soft delete

### DTOs
- **CourseResponseDTO**: Added `contents` list to include course materials

### Services
- **CourseService**: Added methods for creating/updating courses with files
- **CourseContentService**: Changed delete to soft delete, filter queries for non-deleted content

### Controllers
- **AuthController**: Kept as-is (register, login, refresh, logout)
- **UserController**: Simplified to only profile endpoints
- **CourseController**: Modified to handle multipart uploads, removed unnecessary endpoints
- **CourseContentController**: Simplified to only soft delete endpoint

### Repositories
- **CourseContentRepository**: Added methods to filter out soft-deleted content

---

## 📚 Documentation Created

1. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Complete API reference with request/response examples
2. **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed list of all changes made
3. **TESTING_GUIDE.md** - cURL and Postman testing examples
4. **README_API_CHANGES.md** - Quick start guide and overview
5. **database-migration-soft-delete.sql** - SQL script for database updates

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migration script to add soft delete columns:
```sql
-- Run: database-migration-soft-delete.sql
ALTER TABLE course_content ADD COLUMN is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE course_content ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

### 2. Build the Application
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 4. Test the APIs
Follow the examples in **TESTING_GUIDE.md**

---

## 🧪 Quick Test Flow

```bash
# 1. Register
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123"
}

# 2. Login (get token)
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123"
}

# 3. Create Course with Files
POST /api/courses (multipart/form-data)
- course: {"courseName":"Java 101","courseCode":"CS101","description":"...","instructorId":1}
- files: [syllabus.pdf, lecture1.mp4]

# 4. View Course with Content
GET /api/courses/{id}

# 5. Update Profile
PUT /api/users/me
{
  "firstName": "John Updated",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

# 6. Soft Delete Content
DELETE /api/course-content/{id}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Access tokens expire in 1 hour
- Refresh tokens for seamless token renewal
- BCrypt password encryption
- Role-based access control (INSTRUCTOR)

---

## 📁 File Upload Features

**Supported Types:**
- PDF (documents)
- MP4 (videos)
- JPG, JPEG, PNG (images)

**Constraints:**
- Max file size: 10 MB
- Max request size: 50 MB
- Automatic file renaming with timestamps
- Organized storage by course ID

---

## 🗑️ Soft Delete Feature

- Course content is **marked as deleted** (not physically removed)
- Deletion timestamp recorded for audit
- Soft-deleted content automatically excluded from queries
- Original data preserved for compliance/recovery

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **IDE Cache**: If you see "duplicate class" errors in UserController, restart your IDE
2. **Database**: Ensure migration script is run before testing
3. **File Storage**: Ensure `uploads/` directory exists with write permissions
4. **Configuration**: Update `application.properties` with your database credentials
5. **Testing**: Use Postman or cURL for testing multipart endpoints

## 💡 Tips

- **Testing multipart endpoints**: Use Postman or curl with `-F` flag
- **Token management**: Store access token securely, use refresh token when expired
- **File paths**: Use absolute paths in curl commands (Windows: `C:\path\to\file`)
- **Error handling**: Check response status codes and error messages in API documentation
